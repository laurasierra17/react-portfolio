            <p>
                I'm a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida as of May 2022, where I majored in Web
                Design and earned my minor in Computer Science. I've spent the last 2 years working across front-end and
                back-end development and UI/UX. I'm currently looking for a job as a Full-Stack or Front-End Engineer.

                These days I spend my time researching, learning, and coding. Outside my focus zone, I'm watching Korean
                dramas on Netflix, trying new restaurants, or playing with my cat, Lucy.
